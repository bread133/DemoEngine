#Description

This will be simple little 3D engine of RPG games. Also I want to do simple editor of level - wrapper of my future engine, because I declare in subject of studying working.
I don't know, what to do, but I try to do something.
Language of engine - C++ (I try to C#, but it REALLY bad idea, RUST is better way), editor - C# (.NET 7.0). Environment - VS 2022 Community.
I try to cover with tests my code, but i don't sure...
